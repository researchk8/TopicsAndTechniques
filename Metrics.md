# Metrics

A metric is a quantitative measure used to evaluate the performance of a AI application. Metrics help in assessing how well the application and individual components that makes up application is performing relative to the given test data. They provide a numerical basis for comparison, optimization, and decision-making throughout the application development and deployment process. Metrics are crucial for:

- Component Selection: Metrics can be used to compare different components of the AI application like LLM, Retriever, Agent configuration, etc with your own data and select the best one from different options.
- Error Diagnosis and Debugging: Metrics help identify which part of the application is causing errors or suboptimal performance, making it easier to debug and refine.
- Continuous Monitoring and Maintenance: Metrics enable the tracking of an AI applicationâ€™s performance over time, helping to detect and respond to issues such as data drift, model degradation, or changing user requirements.


## Metric Design Principles

Designing effective metrics for AI applications requires following to a set of core principles to ensure their reliability, interpretability, and relevance. Here are five key principles we follow in ragas when designing metrics:

1. Single-Aspect Focus
A single metric should target only one specific aspect of the AI application's performance. This ensures that the metric is both interpretable and actionable, providing clear insights into what is being measured.

2. Intuitive and Interpretable
Metrics should be designed to be easy to understand and interpret. Clear and intuitive metrics make it simpler to communicate results and draw meaningful conclusions.

3. Effective Prompt Flows
When developing metrics using large language models (LLMs), use intelligent prompt flows that align closely with human evaluation. Decomposing complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks with specific prompts can improve the accuracy and relevance of the metric.

4. Robustness
Ensure that LLM-based metrics include sufficient few-shot examples that reflect the desired outcomes. This enhances the robustness of the metric by providing context and guidance for the LLM to follow.

5.Consistent Scoring Ranges
It is crucial to normalize metric score values or ensure they fall within a specific range, such as 0 to 1. This facilitates comparison between different metrics and helps maintain consistency and interpretability across the evaluation framework.

These principles serve as a foundation for creating metrics that are not only effective but also practical and meaningful in evaluating AI applications.
