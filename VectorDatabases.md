# VectorDatabases
Converting text into embedding is a time-consuming process. To avoid that, we have vector databases explicitly designed for efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings.

## Tools

### LanceDB

### Milvus
An open-source vector database designed for developing and maintaining AI applications.

### ChromaDB

### FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
This vector database specializes in efficient similarity searches across big datasets, making it perfect for vector matching.

### Pinecone
A scalable vector search engine optimized for high-performance similarity searches, ideal for applications that require precise vector-based retrieval.

### REALM
Retrieval Augmented Language Model (REALM) Training is a Google toolbox for open-domain question answering using RAG.

### Weaviate
An open-source vector search engine with machine learning models for semantic search.

## Methods

### Hybrid Search

### Multi-Vector-Search
