## Metrics for MAS

### Collaboration

1. **Task Allocation Accuracy** Tasks assigned to the most capable agents.
2. **Communication Latency** Time taken for agent responses (ms).

### Tool Utilization
1. **Tool Success Rate** Percentage of successful tool interactions (API/Functions).
2. **Adaptation Time** Time to adjust to new tools (seconds).


### Output Quality
1. **Task Completion Accuracy** Accuracy of task outputs (%).
2. **Output Coherence** Logical consistency of generated outputs.

### System Performance
1. **Throughput** Tasks completed per hour by all agents.
2. **Fault Recovery Time** Time to recover from errors (seconds).

### Ethical Metrics
1. **Fairness Index** Equitable distribution of tasks/resources.



Once your evaluation framework is in place, itâ€™s time to focus on action. The metrics and insights you gather should guide how you refine your multi-agent systems:

- Tweak Collaboration Protocols: Use metrics to adjust how agents interact and share tasks.
- Enhance Resource Allocation: Data from evaluation frameworks can highlight inefficiencies in tool usage or compute resource distribution.
- Address Bias Proactively: Regular checks with the evaluation frameworks mentioned ensure your MAS outputs are fair and equitable.
