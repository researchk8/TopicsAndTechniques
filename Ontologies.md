## Datasets
- R2R: The Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R)Footnote2 program is the steward of environmental sensor data collected by the U.S. academic research fleet. R2R maintains a catalog of vessels, instrument systems, expeditions, datasets, investigators, organizations, funding awards, cruise reports, and navigation tracks for research cruises.
- BCO-DMO: The Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO)Footnote3 manages data and information generated during oceanographic research efforts and publishes these data online. Many of the datasets contain measurements collected during research cruises on board U.S. academic vessels, details about which are present in the R2R dataset.
- IODP: The International Ocean Discovery ProgramFootnote4 and its predecessor programs involve the collection of sediments, rocks, biota, and fluids from beneath the seafloor. This dataset contains information about these samples and the circumstances under which they were collected.
- MBLWHOI: Marine Biological Laboratory Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (MBLWHOI) LibraryFootnote5 maintains a repository of text documents including technical reports, theses, and journal articles covering topics related to marine life and its environment, along with associated metadata.
- SESAR: The System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR)Footnote6 is a collection of metadata about natural samples such as rocks specimens, water samples, and sediment cores. It includes information about where, when, and how a sample was collected.
- DataONE: The Data Observation Network for EarthFootnote7 provides access to data and metadata from a large number of contributors and repositories related to the earth and environmental sciences. The focus of the project is to provide an integrated portal for the discovery of environmental data for researchers, students, and the general public.
- AGU-NSF: The American Geophysical Union (AGU) has historical data related to its annual conferences as well as NSF funded proposals related to geophysics, including the award information, the project, and the principal and co-principal investigators. There is a large degree of overlap between the people and projects in this dataset and those in the others in this list.
- NGDB: The National Geochemical DatabaseFootnote8 contains information about the geochemical content of thousands of samples from American stream sediments, soils, and waters, as well as metadata about the time and place the sample was collected.
- USAP: The United States Antarctic ProgramFootnote9 Center is dedicated to preserving and making available the result of NSF-funded research related to Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. It includes data about ice coverage, snowfall totals, and glacial movements in the region. The information included in GeoLink is at the dataset level and includes information such as the curator and funding agency.
