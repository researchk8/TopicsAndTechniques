# Prompting

## Components of a Prompt Object

**Instruction**: A fundamental element of any prompt, the instruction is a natural language directive that clearly
describes the task the Language Model (LLM) should perform. This is specified using the instruction variable within the
prompt object.

**Few-Shot Examples**: LLMs are known to perform better when provided with few-shot examples, as they help the model
understand the task context and generate more accurate responses. These examples are specified using the examples
variable in the prompt object. Each example consists of an input and its corresponding output, which the LLM uses to
learn the task.

**Input Model**: Every prompt expects an input to produce an output. In Ragas, the expected format of this input is
defined using the input_model variable. This is a Pydantic model that outlines the structure of the input, enabling
validation and parsing of the data provided to the prompt.

**Output Model**: Upon execution, a prompt generates an output. The format of this output is specified using the
output_model variable in the prompt object. Like the input model, the output model is a Pydantic model that defines the
structure of the output, facilitating validation and parsing of the data produced by the LLM.

## Guidelines for Creating Effective Prompts

When creating prompts, consider the following guidelines to ensure that your prompts are effective and aligned with the
task requirements:

- **Clear and Concise Instructions**: Provide clear and concise instructions that clearly define the task the LLM should
  perform. Ambiguity in instructions can lead to inaccurate responses.
- **Relevant Few-Shot Examples**: Include relevant few-shot examples that cover a diverse range of scenarios related to
  the task (ideally 3-5). These examples help the LLM understand the context and generate accurate responses.
- **Simple Input and Output Models**: Define simple and intuitive input and output models that accurately represent the
  data format expected by the LLM and the output generated by the LLM. If the models are complex, try to break the task
  into smaller sub-tasks with separate prompts.

## Prompt content types

Prompts can include one or more of the following types of content:

### Input (required)

An input is the text in the prompt that you want the model to provide a response for, and it's a required content type.
Inputs can be a question that the model answers (question input), a task the model performs (task input), an entity the
model operates on (entity input), or partial input that the model completes or continues (completion input).

- question inpu
- task input
- entity input
- completion input

### Context (optional)

### Examples (optional)

## Prompt Design Strategies

Following prompt design strategies:

- Give clear and specific instructions
- Include few-shot examples
- Add contextual information
- Add prefixes
- Let the model complete partial input
