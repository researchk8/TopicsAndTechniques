## Large Action Models
Several key characteristics set LAMs apart from other AI models:

- Action-oriented: The primary function of LAMs is to perform actions, not just generate text or provide information. This action-oriented design allows them to interact with and manipulate their environment in ways that traditional language models cannot.
- Contextual understanding: LAMs are equipped with the ability to comprehend the context of a situation. This deep understanding enables them to take appropriate actions that are relevant and meaningful within the given circumstances.
- Goal-driven: LAMs often operate with specific objectives or goals in mind. Whether it's completing a task, solving a problem, or optimizing a process, these models are designed to work towards defined outcomes.
