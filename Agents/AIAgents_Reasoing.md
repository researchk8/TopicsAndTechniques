# Reasoning

Reasoning is the ability to think and validate before responding or taking action.

Reasoning Agents go through an internal chain of thought before responding, working through different ideas, validating
and correcting as needed.

Reasoning models are a new class of large language models trained with reinforcement learning to think before they answer. They produce a long internal chain of thought before responding. Examples of reasoning models include:

- OpenAI o1-pro and o3-mini
- Claude 3.7 sonnet in extended-thinking mode
- Gemini 2.0 flash thinking
- DeepSeek-R1

Reasoning models deeply consider and think through a plan before taking action. Its all about what the model does before it starts generating a response. Reasoning models excel at single-shot use-cases. They’re perfect for solving hard problems (coding, math, physics) that don’t require multiple turns, or calling tools sequentially.

## Reasoning Models

Reasoning models are a separate class of large language models trained with reinforcement learning to think before they
answer. They produce an internal chain of thought before responding. Reasoning at the model layer is all about what the
model does before it starts generating a response. Reasoning models excel at single-shot use-cases. They’re perfect for
solving hard problems (coding, math, physics) that don’t require multiple turns, or calling tools sequentially.

### Reasoning Tools

By giving a model a “think” tool, we can greatly improve its reasoning capabilities by providing a dedicated space for
structured thinking. This is a simple, yet effective approach to add reasoning to non-reasoning models.
