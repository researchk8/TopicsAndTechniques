# AI Agents
Agents are autonomous programs that use language models to achieve tasks. They solve problems by running tools, accessing knowledge and memory to improve responses.

Instead of a rigid binary definition, letâ€™s think of Agents in terms of agency and autonomy.

- Level 0: Agents with no tools (basic inference tasks).
- Level 1: Agents with tools for autonomous task execution.
- Level 2: Agents with knowledge, combining memory and reasoning.
- Level 3: Teams of agents collaborating on complex workflows.


## Components

### Tools
Agents use tools to take actions and interact with external systems. Tools are functions that an Agent can run to achieve tasks. For example: searching the web, running SQL, sending an email or calling APIs.

### Knowledge
Agents use knowledge to supplement their training data with domain expertise. Knowledge is stored in a vector database and provides agents with business context at query time, helping them respond in a context-aware manner. 

#### Vector Databases
While any type of storage can act as a knowledge base, vector databases offer the best solution for retrieving relevant results from dense information quickly.
